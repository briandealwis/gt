Simple steps to port code using the "classic" GT to "new" GT:

 1. Replace the old GT .DLLs (e.g., GTClient.dll, GTServer.dll); add
    the new GTBase.dll
 2. Replace all namespace references:
	GTClient -> GT.Net
	GTServer -> GT.Net

 3. Replace internal class references to their new corresponding interfaces:
	ObjectStream -> IObjectStream
	StringStream -> IStringStream
	SessionStream -> ISessionStream
	ByteStream -> IByteStream

 4. Change calls to Client.StartListeningOnSeperateThread(int) and
    Server.StartSeparateListeningThread(int) to just use 
    StartSeparateListeningThread(), and configure the listen interval
    as the configuration's TickInterval.

 5. Adjust calls to Client.Get*Stream() to provide a
    ChannelDeliveryRequirements object.  ChannelDeliveryRequirements
    provides a number of predefined requirements:
	LeastStrict: Unreliable, Unordered, can be aggregated
	TelepointerLike: Unreliable, Sequenced, must be sent immediately
	ChatLike: Reliable, Ordered, unaggregatable and should first
	    flush all other messages on this channel
	CommandsLike: Reliable, Ordered, unaggregatable and should first
	    flush all other messages on this channel
	SessionLike: Reliable, Unordered (?), unaggregatable and
	    must flush all outstanding messages.
	Data: Reliable, Ordered, aggregatable.
	MostStrict: Reliable, Ordered, unaggregatable and must flush
	    all outstanding messages.
