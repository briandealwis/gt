ChangeLog

Breaking Changes:

  * As part of reorganizing the code, we've renamed the namespaces
    (GTServer and GTClient -> GT.Server and GT.Client) and introduced
    a new assembly to hold common components and useful new components
    (GT.Common).  <https://papyrus.usask.ca/trac/gt/ticket/7

      * Change all the uses
	  'using GTServer;'  ->  'using GT.Server;'
	  'using GTClient;'  ->  'using GT.Client;'

      * You will need to add the GTCommon project or DLL to your clients,
        and add 'using GT.Common;' to your namespaces.

New additions

  * Added a lifecycle protocol consisting of Start(), Stop(), and
    Dispose() methods, and a Running read-only property.  These methods
    have been added to most GT user-visible objects to respectively
    start, stop, and dispose of any system object. 
    
      * Client.StartListening() and Server.StartListening() both
        automatically Start() and Stop() their respective instances.
	This ensures that the clients and servers are closed in
	their normal usage.
	<https://papyrus.usask.ca/trac/gt/ticket/22>

      * Client.Update() and Server.Update() will automagically
	call Start() if their instance has not already been started.
	This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future
	release.

  * Added Client.Sleep() and Server.Sleep() methods: these new methods
    provide a much more efficient way of servicing incoming messages
    while sleeping and greatly improve the fairness of servicing
    GT requests.

  * Began creating unit tests using NUnit <http://nunit.org>

Re-organized source code

  * Separated example programs from the core client and server
    components <https://papyrus.usask.ca/trac/gt/ticket/10>

  * Created GT.Common and corresponding assembly to hold types common
    to the client and server; this is a breaking change for clients
