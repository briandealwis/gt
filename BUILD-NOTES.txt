Deployment & Building the MSI installer
=======================================

The deployment project (GT.Setup) assumes the manual has been PDF'd
and the Doxygen documentation has been generated.

  * To build the PDF of the manual, use Adobe Distiller.
    (Actually, Word for the Mac is much faster and seems to produce
    a better quality PDF to boot.)

  * To generate the Doxygen docs, run the following command in the doc/
    directory:

	$ doxygen gt.dox

    The results will be placed in the doc/html/ directory.
