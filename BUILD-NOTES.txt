Deployment & Building the MSI installer
=======================================

These instructions are specifically for building the MSI installer
for GT using VisualStudio 2008, and are intended to complement the
instructions documented on the GT Trac.

The deployment project (GT.Setup) assumes the manual has been PDF'd:

  * To build the PDF of the manual, use Adobe Distiller.
    (Actually, Word for the Mac is much faster and seems to produce
    a better quality PDF.)

  * We currently don't package the Doxygen files (I couldn't figure out
    a nice way to pull them in).  To generate the Doxygen docs, run
    the following command in the doc/ directory:

	$ doxygen gt.dox

    The results will be placed in the doc/html/ directory.

To build the MSI: first decide if you want to distribute using a
Release configuration or the Debug configuration.  We've been releasing
the Debug configuration as people have been more focussed on being able
to debug their apps at the expense of a slight performance problem.

  * Clean the solution (Build -> Clean Solution) to remove all any
    previously generated stuff.

 [* Change your active solution's build type to "Release" (toolbar near
    the green play arrow, or use Build -> Configuration Manager).]

  * Rebuild the solution (Build -> Rebuild).  It's helpful to have
    the "Output" window open.  Ensure there are no failures.

     [* You may want to re-run the unit tests to be sure there is
	no code depends on the debug behaviour.]

  * Build the GT.MergeModule to build the merge module.
    Don't "Rebuild" as otherwise the AssemblyVersions will be bumped
    in GTBase.dll, GTClient.dll, GTServer.dll, GTUI.dll and no longer
    match the versions specified in any of the other projects.

  * Build the GT.Setup to build the MSI installer.
    Ditto for the rebuild.
    There should be no warnings.

Install the GT MSI and ensure the ClientRepeater and all examples work.
